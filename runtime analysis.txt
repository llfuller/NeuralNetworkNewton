numSamples = 1000
numEpochs = 1000
Time: 232 Seconds

numSamples = 1000
numEpochs = 100
31 Seconds


numSamples = 10,000
numEpochs = 100
202 Seconds

Run time looks linear in number of sampes and epochs.

I tried 
numSamples = 1000
numEpochs = 10000
Which should have taken about 3000 seconds, or 50 minutes.

So for the supercomputer:
numSamples = 10,000
numEpochs = 10,000
The overestimate is 30,000 seconds, or 500 minutes or 8.3 hours.
