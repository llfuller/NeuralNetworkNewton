# NeuralNetworkNewton
Learning kinematic behavior and elastic collisions by watching point particles collide.
Independent project for neurodynamics course Phys279 at UCSD.

Result Summary: Doesn't work very well.

How to get started:
Run SimulateCollisions.py to generate collisions and all state variables + time data for two particles.
Run SimulateMisses.py to generate mixed collision/non-collision data.

Extra notes:
CheckConservation.py checks that energy and momentum are conserved by the collisions.
CheckPosition.py graphs position of particles as they collide.
