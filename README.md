# NeuralNetworkNewton
Learning Newton's laws of motion by watching point particles collide.
2-D elastic collisions of classical point particles.
Run SimulateCollisions.py to generate collisions and all state variables + time data for two particles.
CheckConservation.py checks that energy and momentum are conserved by the collisions.
CheckPosition.py graphs position of particles as they collide
